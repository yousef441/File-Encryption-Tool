#  SecureVault AI – Intelligent File Encryption & Management System

# Developer: [Yousef441](https://github.com/yousef441)  
> “Protecting your digital privacy through intelligent encryption.”

---

##  Overview
"SecureVault AI" is a smart file encryption and management system built in **Python**, designed to help users securely encrypt, decrypt, and manage their files using advanced cryptography.  
The system uses **Fernet (AES-based)** encryption and integrates an **AI-powered module** to analyze file sensitivity and automatically suggest the best encryption level for each file.

This project combines **Cybersecurity** and **Artificial Intelligence** — two of the most critical fields in modern software engineering.

---

##  Features
-Secure file encryption and decryption (AES/Fernet)  
-  Auto key generation and management  
-  Simple and efficient command-line interface (CLI)  
-  Planned GUI version using **Tkinter or PyQt**  
-  AI-powered sensitivity detection (prototype)  
-  Fast local processing (offline, no cloud dependencies)  
-  Optional future integration with cloud backups (Google Drive / Dropbox)

---

##  AI Sensitivity Detection (Coming Soon)
An upcoming feature uses a simple ML model (Scikit-learn or rules-based logic) to:
- Classify file sensitivity (e.g., “Low”, “Medium”, “High”)  
- Suggest encryption strength or additional security measures  
- Help automate encryption policies for different file types
